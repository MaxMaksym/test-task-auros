This is a Spring MVC project structured in the following way:

1. **configuration**: Contains the configuration files for the application, such as database configuration, security configuration, etc.

2. **controller**: Contains the controllers that handle incoming requests and returns the appropriate responses. These controllers are responsible for receiving data, processing it, and passing it to the service layer for further processing.

3. **dto**: Contains the data transfer objects (DTOs) used by the application. These DTOs are used to transfer data between different layers of the application.

4. **exception**: Contains custom exceptions that can be thrown by the application. These exceptions are used to provide meaningful error messages to the users of the application.

5. **mapper**: Contains the mapper classes used by the application to convert between different data types. These mapper classes are used to convert between DTOs and model objects.

6. **model**: Contains the model classes used by the application to represent data. These model classes are used to represent entities in the database and are also used as input and output parameters for service methods.

7. **repository**: Contains the repository classes used by the application to access data in the database. These repository classes are responsible for executing queries and returning data.

8. **service**: Contains the service classes used by the application to perform business logic. These service classes are responsible for coordinating between different layers of the application and executing business logic.
